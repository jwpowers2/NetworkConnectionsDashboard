# Network Connections Dashboard

### A simple Web UI Dashboard for monitoring network connections on a Linux Device

### NCD uses the Python Flask Microframework

#### The Web Template refreshes itself every five seconds and fires the single endpoint,

#### causing the network connections count to fire and the data to be normalized 

#### for the UI.  

#### NCD was built as a tool for demonstrating Denial of Service effects on connection

#### counts such as those from syn floods.
